README file for the Phased Array Feed Fast Radio Burst pipeline.

1. INSTALLATION
    
    Makefile should work without problems.


2. USAGE

    Before running the pipeline, make sure the FPGAs are sending the data and that correct FPGAs are received.
    Most crucially FPGAs with IDs 0 and 47 have to stream in order for the data to be processed properly.
    To check this, run the ./tools/fpga_test on each node.
    This can be done automatically, byt running the ./test_all script from the pktos01.

    The code can be started using either a long list of command line options or configuration file.
    The example configuration file is attached in config.conf.
    To start the GPU processing on the node use /home/user/paf/bin/pafrb --config /config/file/directory.
    Numa node configuration varies slightly between nodes, and each node has to have its own configuration file.
    These have to be saved in directories accessible ONLY from the given node - /home/user/ directories will not work.
    To run the code on multiple nodes, start the ./tools/mul_gpu script on pktos01
