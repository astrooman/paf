PAFFINDER - Phased Array Feed FRB Finder

1. INSTALLATION
    
    Makefile should work without problems.

2. USAGE

    The code can be started using either a long list of command line options or configuration file.
    The example configuration file is attached in config.conf.
    To start the GPU processing on the node use /home/user/paf/bin/pafrb --config /config/file/directory.
    Numa node configuration varies slightly between nodes, and each node has to have its own configuration file.
    These have to be saved in directories accessible ONLY from the given node - /home/user/ directories will not work.
